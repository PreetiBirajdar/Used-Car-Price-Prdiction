Used Car Price Prediction

This project focuses on predicting the prices of used cars using linear regression algorithm. The goal of this project is to develop a model that can accurately estimate the price of a used car based on its various features. By leveraging machine learning techniques and historical used car data, we aim to create a predictive model that can assist buyers and sellers in making informed decisions.



Project Overview
In this project, we explore a dataset of used car listings, which includes information such as the car's make, model, year, mileage, fuel type, transmission, and more. The dataset provides a valuable resource for training and evaluating a linear regression model to predict car prices.


Objectives
The main objectives of this project are as follows:
1. Understand and analyze the used car dataset, including its features and target variable.
2. Preprocess and clean the dataset, handling missing values and transforming categorical variables as necessary.
3. Perform feature engineering and selection to identify the most relevant features for the prediction task.
4. Split the dataset into training and testing sets for model development and evaluation.
5. Implement a linear regression algorithm to train a predictive model on the training data.
6. Evaluate the model's performance using appropriate metrics and assess its ability to accurately predict car prices.
7. Fine-tune the model by experimenting with hyperparameters and regularization techniques.
8. Deploy the trained model and provide an interface for users to input car features and obtain predicted prices.


Technologies and Tools Used
The following technologies and tools were utilized for this project:
1. Python: Programming language used for data analysis, modeling, and implementation.
2. Colab Notebook: Interactive environment for running code and documenting the analysis.
3. Pandas: Library for data manipulation and analysis.
4. Scikit-learn: Library for machine learning algorithms and model evaluation.
5. NumPy: Library for numerical computing.
6. Matplotlib and Seaborn: Libraries for data visualization.


Results and Findings
The results and findings of the used car price prediction project using linear regression are summarized as follows:
1. Evaluation of the model's performance, including metrics such as mean squared error (MSE) and R-squared.
2. Identification of the most important features influencing the predicted car prices.
3. Insights into the limitations and assumptions of the linear regression model.
